# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project. 
This README also applies to all the other repositories in the organization.

## Testing
To test please make sure you are using a Raspberry Pi, on a hardware level as emulators might have their own problem.

## Reporting Issues
When reporting issues make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Make sure when you make an issue you specify which specific model on which you have the problem on.
- Before writing the issue title, please prefix the issue type, ```Problem:```, ```Question:```, ```PR Discussion:```.
- Please make sure somebody hasn't already reported the same problem, so you don't end up making a duplicate.

## Submitting changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ShadityOS](https://github.com/ShadityOS/ShadityOS/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done 
(read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Before writing the issue title, please prefix the issue 
type, ```Fix:```, ```Feature:```, ```Optimization:```. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Thanks,
ShadityZ, ShadityOS Head Developer
