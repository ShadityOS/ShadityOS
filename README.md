2. For Etcher, click "Flash from file" and choose the image you downloaded earlier. For RPi Imager, click "Choose Image", scroll down and click "Custom Image". Choose the image you downloaded earlier.

3. Choose "Select target" and choose the device you plan to install ShadityOS onto. 

4. Click "Flash" or "Write" and wait for the write to finish.
